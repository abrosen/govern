\title{How to Build Distributed Governed Systems}
\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	
	
	Developers and researchers typically use one of two models when building a distributed system.
	The first is a completely centralized model, where one server or person is in control.
	The other alternative is a completely decentralized model, where no single entity has control, except for perhaps the protocol itself.
	
	In practice, this is not the only models that exist in the wild.  
	
	
	How can we create a system that balances multiple powerful entities against each other.
	
	
	
	Nomic is a game created by Peter Suber in 1982 \cite{nomic}.
	The initial rules of the game define a goal (gaining points) and describe how Nomic works.
	Each ``move'' in the game is a proposition to add, remove, or amend the rules of the game (unless of course, the rules have defined new actions that players can take for their turns).
	Any modification to the rules is then voted upon by the players and goes into effect (again, unless the rules have moved the system away from a democracy).
	The player then collects points.
	
	Previous work has been done on using Nomic as the system for blockchain based systems for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies \cite{tezos} using a constructed language.
	We want to show how Nomic can be used as the basis for building a wide variety self-governing distributed systems, from blockchains, to administrating servers, to solving very interesting problems in managing DNS and security, such as key revocation.
	
	Because Nomic is a system for laying down rules, defining who can do what and who has power, we can use it to simulate just about any governmental form of management. 
	Some examples:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An autocracy, a system where power and authority is vested in a single entity. 
		\item An aristocracy, where only chosen members of the system get to vote, or even have a voice.
		\item A plutocracy, where a large sum of currency is needed to participate. In other words, he who has the gold makes the rules.
		\item A representative democracy, where users in the system collectively appoint individuals to act as their proxy or proxies.
		\item A pure democracy, where each users can or must vote on each issue.
	\end{itemize}
	
	There are many variations that can be taken from history.  
	For example, a representative democracy might elect to temporarily appoint a dictator with a wide range of powers, but limited in certain capacities, much like the Roman dictator and general Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus.
	
	
	\section{Creating Your Own Nomic Based System}
	
	
	Nomic's initial rules are extremely simple, but allow us to create an incredibly complex systems.
	Likewise, we will present a abstract way to build a Nomic based system.
	
	The first thing is to determine your initial ruleset.
	We suggest everyone
